# 4fun-client

4fun-client is, as its name says, the client part of 4fun, a web application created to show how easy is to communicate a client with a nodejs server using a RESTful API and an implementation of WebSockets.

The server for this client is [available here](https://github.com/davidmogar/4fun-server). Take a look ;)

## Structure
The client it's divided in a website with controls to move the user player and send message to the chat, and a panel to show all players positions and messages. The next images show these sites:
